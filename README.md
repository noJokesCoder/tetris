# Tetris game

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/d4efd6c8-e330-4277-9db4-7e2fcf5d9abf/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/tetris-game-onreact/deploys)

_It is a little game I built when following the tutorial provided by freeCodeCamp_

## The game is easy to play, though it's not optimized for running on mobile.

## Check out the results here -> Link-to-Play

## Tech stack in the project:

- React (bootstrapped with [Create React App])
- React hooks
- Styled-componets ("CSS-in-JS")
- React.memo()
- Netlify (hosting)

## Short memo for myself:

> When building it I learnt the following:
> how to use styled-component,
> how to import fonts with @font-face value,
> how to structure the project in overall and
> that React may not be the best option for building games =-)
